INSTALLATION

On Pico
Copy pico/main.py to the Pico storage, using Thonny.

On Pi
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
to upgrade existing packages:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

Raspberry Pi OS may also need SDL2 libraries:
sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0
Raspberry Pi OS may need maths libraries from this package for numpy to work
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev

# For development, if you want graphical app on local display from remote session
export SDL_FBDEV=/dev/fb0
# Disable mouse driver, including OS touch mouse emulation
export SDL_MOUSEDRV=/dev/null
# App may need to run with root permissions in order to access framebuffer
sudo ./app.py

# Enable more memory for video driver in performance options
# Set it for 128Mb to allow 800x600 driver to work in framebuffer (non-X) mode
sudo raspi-config

# Check touchscreen device on the commandline
hexdump /dev/input/event0
evtest


# On Ubuntu/Mac/Windows WSL (development)
Installation as per Raspberry Pi OS will work (MacOS will need XCode command line tools)

# On MS Windows (without WSL)
On native Windows, the go.sh run script will not work.
However, code paths have been arranged so that principal parts of the simulator can run
on Windows. Use go.bat, or python go.py, instead of go.sh.
